## Thoughts

This project was purely about using css grid as much as possible to match the given image.  It was pretty tough, and I feel like my css is pretty sloppy, but the image is pretty close.  I don't want to get hung up doing this project over and over, but I do think I need to do more of these "match this layout" excercises before I get anynear comfortable laying these out.
